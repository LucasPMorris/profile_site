    Hi, I am Lucas Morris!
</p>
<p>
	Thank you for stopping by my little space on the internet. It has been over 35 years since the first time I have typed commands into my first personal computer. Since that first moment, I couldn’t imagine life without a keyboard—and all the incredible innovations that followed.
</p>
<p>
	In highschool I picked up my first job stocking shelves at CompUSA, "the computer superstore", drooling over all the different components I was nowhere close to affording at that time. Little did I know then how much my life and my career would be shaped by technology.
</p>
<p>
    I've had countless light bulb moments where you get an immense and immediate sense of gratification for solving that next riddle. The first time you see your own web page on the internet; the correct motherboard post beep after building your first computer; or the first time calibrating a 6 axis motion stabilized gimbal with an augmented reality system in a helicopter.  
</p>
<p>
	My experience with technology spans a wide range of industries, software and hardware, commercial and personal. I've dabbled in the shallow end with some tech and dove into the deep end with others. There has been no shortage of incredibly cool tech to be inspired by.  
</p>
<p>
    As I've grown my career I realized that I was drawn to seeing others experience those moments. I've made a career out of inspiring and leading teams of talented people to do powerful, meaningful, and impactful work with technology. I'm always looking for like-minded curious people, please reach out if you have an idea or an interest in working together!
</p>
<p>
    I'm looking forward to the possibility of working with you!
</p>
