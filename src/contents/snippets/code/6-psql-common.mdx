These snippets are incredibly common and are very useful in everyday PostgreSQL usage. Some of these will become so familiar that you will not even think about them anymore, others it is just easy some time to cut and paste!

<br/>

<br/>

> Basic SELECT with WHERE
```sql
SELECT id, name, email 
FROM users 
WHERE active = true 
  AND created_at > '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```
**Function:** Basic query pattern with filtering, ordering, and limiting results. Most common SQL operation.

<br/>

<br/>

> JOIN Tables
```sql
SELECT u.name, p.title, p.created_at
FROM users u
INNER JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE u.active = true;
```
**Function:** Combine data from multiple tables using relationships. INNER JOIN only returns matching records.

<br/>

---

<br/>

> LEFT JOIN for Optional Relationships
```sql
SELECT u.name, COUNT(p.id) as post_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.name;
```
**Function:** Include all users even if they have no posts. LEFT JOIN preserves all records from the left table.

<br/>

<br/>

> INSERT with RETURNING
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, created_at)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com', NOW())
RETURNING id, created_at;
```
**Function:** Insert data and immediately return specified columns, useful for getting auto-generated IDs.

<br/>

---

<br/>

> UPDATE with Conditions
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET last_login = NOW(), 
    login_count = login_count + 1
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```
**Function:** Modify existing records with conditions. Can update multiple columns and use expressions.

<br/>

---

<br/>

> UPSERT (INSERT ON CONFLICT)
```sql
INSERT INTO user_preferences (user_id, theme, language)
VALUES (1, 'dark', 'en')
ON CONFLICT (user_id) 
DO UPDATE SET 
  theme = EXCLUDED.theme,
  language = EXCLUDED.language;
```
**Function:** Insert if record doesn't exist, update if it does. Prevents duplicate key errors.

<br/>

---

<br/>

> Basic Aggregation
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_users,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN active THEN 1 END) as active_users,
  AVG(age) as average_age
FROM users;
```
**Function:** Get summary statistics using COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX with optional conditional counting.

<br/>

---

<br/>

> Date/Time Filtering
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
  AND created_at < CURRENT_DATE;
```
**Function:** Filter records by date ranges using PostgreSQL's date/time functions and intervals.

<br/>

---

<br/>

> CASE Statement
```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  age,
  CASE 
    WHEN age < 18 THEN 'Minor'
    WHEN age < 65 THEN 'Adult'
    ELSE 'Senior'
  END as age_group
FROM users;
```
**Function:** Conditional logic in SELECT statements, like if-else for SQL queries.

<br/>

<br/>

> Common Table Expression (CTE)
```sql
WITH recent_orders AS (
  SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as order_count
  FROM orders
  WHERE created_at > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT u.name, ro.order_count
FROM users u
JOIN recent_orders ro ON u.id = ro.user_id;
```
**Function:** Create temporary named result set for complex queries. Makes queries more readable and reusable.
