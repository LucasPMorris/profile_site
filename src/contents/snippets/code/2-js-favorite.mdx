These are my favorite Javascript snippets. Some are common, others are obscure, or I just happen to use them a lot.

> Multi-line Comment
```
/*
This is a multi-line comment, it will be ignored by the interpreter
*/
```
**Function:** Used to comment out multiple lines or write longer explanations. Note that within a componenents return statement you will need to use `{/* comment */}` instead.

> Ternary Operator
```
{ (x + 5 === 10)
    ? <span>X equals 5</span>
    : <span>X does not equal 5</span> 
}
```
**Function:** A shorthand for an if-else statement. It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false.
