These are my favorite terminal snippets. Some are common, others are obscure, or I just happen to use them a lot in my development workflow.

<br/>

> Git Workflow Shortcuts
```bash
# My favorite git aliases
alias gs='git status'
alias gp='git push'
alias gl='git log --oneline --graph --decorate'
alias gd='git diff'
alias ga='git add .'
alias gc='git commit -m'

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Interactive rebase for cleaning history
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Stash with message
git stash push -m "work in progress on feature X"
```
**Function:** Speed up Git workflow with aliases and powerful commands for managing commit history and temporary changes.

> Development Server Shortcuts
```bash
# Quick HTTP server for static files
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .

# Find and kill process on port
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Monitor file changes and restart server
find . -name "*.js" | entr -r npm start

# Quick port check
nc -zv localhost 3000
```
**Function:** Quickly serve files, manage development servers, and handle port conflicts during development.

> File and Directory Shortcuts
```bash
# Create directory and cd into it
mkcd() { mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"; }

# Find file and open in editor
ff() { find . -name "*$1*" -type f | head -5; }

# Quick backup of file
bak() { cp "$1" "$1.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"; }

# Get file size in human readable format

alias df='df -h'
```
**Function:** Convenient functions for common file operations, finding files, and creating backups.

> Log Analysis Made Easy
```bash
# Follow multiple log files
tail -f /var/log/*.log

# Search logs with context
grep -A 5 -B 5 "ERROR" app.log

# Count occurrences of patterns
grep -c "404" access.log

# Show unique IPs from access log
awk '{print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Filter logs by time range
sed -n '/2023-09-06 10:00/,/2023-09-06 11:00/p' app.log
```
**Function:** Efficiently analyze log files, find errors, count patterns, and extract specific time ranges.

> System Monitoring Favorites
```bash
# Monitor disk usage and alert
watch -n 30 'df -h | grep -E "(8[0-9]|9[0-9])%"'

# Show top CPU processes
ps aux | sort -nrk 3,3 | head -5

# Memory usage by process
ps aux | sort -nrk 4,4 | head -5

# Network connections summary
ss -tuln | grep LISTEN | wc -l

# Check system load
uptime | awk '{print $NF}'
```
**Function:** Monitor system health, track resource usage, and quickly identify performance bottlenecks.

> Docker and Container Management
```bash
# Clean up Docker system
docker system prune -a

# Get shell in running container
docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash

```bash
# Quickly edit and reload bash config
alias bashrc='vim ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc'

# Show environment variables for debugging
env | grep -i node

# Quick PATH manipulation
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set temporary environment for command

# Check which command is being used
which node
type node
```
**Function:** Manage shell configuration, environment variables, and debug PATH issues during development.

```bash
# History search with fzf (if installed)
ctrl-r # then type to search

# Quick calculator
calc() { echo "scale=2; $*" | bc; }
